remote
======

##### Remote control your PC(s) using a web interface. 

Each PC acts as a slave that implements commands (nodejs scripts in a certain form).
It connects to the server using a web socket and listens for the commands to be executed.

Using the web interface, one can see the list of currently connected slaves, execute commands and check the status of previously executed commands.
